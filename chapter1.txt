**What If We're the Aliens' Sitcom?**

Imagine some advanced civilization stumbled across Earth and decided we'd make excellent entertainment. They're probably gathered around their equivalent of a TV right now, binge-watching "Humans: The Series" and placing bets on whether we'll figure out climate change before we invent flying cars. Our political elections are their reality TV drama, and they're absolutely fascinated by our obsession with putting tiny computers in our pockets just to argue with strangers about pineapple on pizza.

The alien equivalent of a couch potato is probably munching on space snacks, turning to their friend and saying, "Can you believe they haven't noticed that obvious plot hole in their economic system?" Meanwhile, their kids are doing school reports on human mating rituals, completely baffled by dating apps and wondering why we make romance so unnecessarily complicated. We're not being invaded â€“ we're being renewed for another season.

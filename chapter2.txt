**The Peculiar Charm of Airport Liminal Spaces**

There's something oddly magical about being stuck in an airport at 6 AM with a delayed flight and terrible coffee. You're suspended between destinations, between sleep and wakefulness, watching strangers drag wheeled suitcases across polished floors like modern nomads. Everyone looks slightly disheveled and mildly confused, united in this shared state of transit limbo.

These sterile, fluorescent-lit terminals somehow become intimate spaces where you overhear phone calls about missed anniversaries and business deals, where you watch someone FaceTime their dog, where the woman next to you shares her phone charger without being asked. For a few hours, we're all just humans waiting to be somewhere else, and there's an unexpected comfort in that collective pause.

**The Galactic Real Estate Problem**

Every alien abduction story assumes extraterrestrials traveled light-years just to poke around in our brains, but what if they're actually just cosmic house hunters? Picture it: some alien family cruising through the galaxy with their real estate agent, checking out Earth like it's a fixer-upper in a decent school district. "The atmosphere needs work, and the dominant species is a bit chaotic, but look at those ocean views!"

They probably have a whole Zillow equivalent where Earth gets mixed reviews. "Great location, three moons would be better but one is adequate. Biodiversity is impressive but the carbon emissions are concerning. Previous tenants (dinosaurs) left the place in excellent condition, current occupants are still settling in. Warning: residents may approach your vehicle and attempt communication through interpretive dance and aggressive hand gestures."

The crop circles aren't mysterious messages â€“ they're just alien teenagers doing donuts in dad's spaceship while he's inside arguing with mom about whether Earth has good resale value.

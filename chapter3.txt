**The Secret Life of Houseplants**

My fiddle leaf fig has developed what I can only describe as an attitude. It drops exactly one leaf every time I forget to water it for more than four days, like some passive-aggressive roommate leaving dirty dishes in the sink as a message. Meanwhile, my pothos has quietly taken over half the living room, trailing its vines across bookshelves with the confidence of someone who knows they're the favorite child.

I've started talking to them during my morning coffee routine, updating them on my weekend plans and asking their opinions on whether I should repot the snake plant (they remain diplomatically silent). The spider plant has produced six babies this month alone, and I'm starting to suspect it's plotting some kind of green takeover. At this point, I'm less of a plant parent and more of a landlord running a very leafy boarding house.
